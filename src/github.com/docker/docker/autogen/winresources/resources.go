// AUTOGENERATED FILE; see hack/make/.go-autogen
package winresources

/*

This package is for embedding a manifest file and an icon into docker.exe.
The benefit of this is that a manifest file does not need to be alongside
the .exe, and there is an icon when docker runs, or viewed through Windows
explorer.

When make binary is run, the Dockerfile prepares the build environment by:

 - Cloning github.com/akavel/rsrc

 - Go-installing the rsrc executable

make.sh invokes hack/make/.go-autogen to:

 - Run rsrc to create a binary file (autogen/winresources/rsrc.syso) that 
   contains the manifest and icon. This file is automatically picked up by 
   'go build', so no post-processing steps are required. The sources for 
   rsrc.syso are under hack/make/.resources-windows.
