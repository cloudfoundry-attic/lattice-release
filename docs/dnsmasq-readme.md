1) Use Homebrew to install `dnsmasq`
```bash
# Update your homebrew installation
brew up
# Install dnsmasq
brew install dnsmasq
```

2) Use the commands provided by `brew info dnsmasq` to configure and start the service:

==> Caveats
To configure dnsmasq, copy the example configuration to /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
and edit to taste.

  cp /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.conf.example /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf

To have launchd start dnsmasq at startup:
    sudo cp -fv /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
    sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
Then to load dnsmasq now:
    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
```

## Configuration

### Set up dnsmasq to resolve `lattice.dev`

1. Append line to `/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf` 
```
address=/lattice.dev/<LATTICE_SYSTEM_IP> # i.e., 192.168.11.11
```

2. Restart dnsmasq service
```bash
sudo launchctl stop homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
sudo launchctl start homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
```

### Configure workstation to use dnsmasq resolver for `lattice.dev`

1) Create `/etc/resolver` folder
```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/resolver
```
2) Define resolver for `lattice.dev`
```bash
sudo tee /etc/resolver/lattice.dev >/dev/null <<EOF
nameserver 127.0.0.1
EOF
```

## Starting Lattice cluster with alternate name

1) Set `LATTICE_SYSTEM_DOMAIN` environment variable during `vagrant up`:
```
LATTICE_SYSTEM_DOMAIN=lattice.dev vagrant up --provider=<PROVIDER> 
```

### Validating setup
```
% host www.lattice.dev 127.0.0.1
Using domain server:
Name: 127.0.0.1
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
Aliases: 

www.lattice.dev has address 192.168.11.11
```

```
% host www.yahoo.com 127.0.0.1
Using domain server:
Name: 127.0.0.1
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
Aliases: 

www.yahoo.com is an alias for fd-fp3.wg1.b.yahoo.com.
fd-fp3.wg1.b.yahoo.com has address 206.190.36.45
fd-fp3.wg1.b.yahoo.com has address 206.190.36.105
fd-fp3.wg1.b.yahoo.com has IPv6 address 2001:4998:c:a06::2:4008
